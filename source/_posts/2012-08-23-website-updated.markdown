The old website had an obscure, needed-Google-to-find-it address, and was generated server-side, so it could be a bit slow.  The new page you're seeing was built with Octopress and is hosted on GitHub Pages.  Since it's all statically generated pages now, it should load super-quick, and it'll be easier to add blog entries and do page customization.  

Try it out, and let us know what you think!

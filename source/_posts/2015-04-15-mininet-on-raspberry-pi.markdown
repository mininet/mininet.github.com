Mininet is now easy to install on the Raspberry Pi running Debian/Raspbian 7 Wheezy!

Mininet's `install.sh` has been updated so it should simply work:

    install.sh -fnv  ## basic install
    install.sh -a    ## the works

Here is an example of **Mininet running on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B**:

A Raspberry Pi can be used any time you need a cheap **network-in-a-box**, for example
for courses, laboratories, demonstrations, or simple experiments.

We look forward to hearing (on `mininet-discuss` and elsewhere) about interesting,
fun and clever uses of Mininet running on the Pi !!

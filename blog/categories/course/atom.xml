    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just want to put in a recommendation for Nick Feamster’s excellent Software Defined Networking course. It’s free on Coursera, and not only does he do a great job of clearly explaining SDN, network virtualization, and related topics, he has also created some excellent videos explaining the usage, design, and rationale for the Mininet system, which is also being used for programming assignments and labs in the course.</p>

<p>There are also interesting interviews with notable people like Martin Casado, David Clark, and Teemu Koponen. It’s quite excellent, very approachable for anyone who has a basic networking background, and highly recommended:</p>

<p>The course has already started, but as of today (Thursday July 11th) you can still sign up for it.</p>
